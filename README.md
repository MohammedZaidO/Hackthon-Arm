VishwaBot: A.I. Arm for Industry & Space
This voice-controlled robotic arm uses AI (NLP & Computer
Vision) to automate tasks and improve efficiency


## PROBLEM STATEMENT ü§î

Many industrial and daily tasks rely on manual manipulation of objects, leading to
limitations. Repetitive tasks can cause fatigue and injury, while dexterity
limitations affect people with disabilities. Current robotic solutions often lack the
flexibility and intelligence for precise object handling in diverse environments.

This project addresses these challenges by developing an AI-powered robotic
arm. Combining voice control and computer vision, the arm will seamlessly
identify, grasp, and place objects. This not only improves efficiency and safety in
industries, but also empowers individuals with disabilities by offering a versatile
and intelligent assistive technology.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

**Hardware Layer:** : Servos

**Software Layer:** Programming Language (C++, Python), NLP Library, Computer Vision Library


## Deployment üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

Our project successfully deployed a multi-modal robotic system for real-world interaction. By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding user commands, computer vision for object identification, and servo motors for physical response, the robot can interpret instructions, visually recognize objects, and perform targeted actions. This integration allows for a more intuitive and versatile human-robot collaboration experience.
```bash
  import speech_recognition as sr  # recognise speech
```
